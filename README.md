# Open Intelligence

## Origian code base:  [Martin Kankaanranta aka norkator ](https://github.com/norkator)

Credit for the idea and the original code base to norkator https://github.com/norkator/open-intelligence.

## What I've done

I've rewritten majority of backend python, 100% of the AI used.

## What I still need to do

Change the database table named data, a many columns, mostly empty, terribly named thing. but kept the front end, since any UI I don't have to build is great UI.
